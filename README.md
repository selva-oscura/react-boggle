# react-boggle

React and Firebase Boggle app
(No patent infringement intended and no intent to divert funds from the game's owners. it just seemed like a fun programming challenge.)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run a cloned copy, from the root directory, type
  npm install
then
  npm start
